## Project 1: File Formats - Convert and Display City Data
### Ally Moore
### Description:
  The general idea behind this program is to use python to read in a json file and output a geoJson file. The goal is to create a geoJson file that contains a fictitious route visiting the single most populated city in each state. Only the continental US and DC, but not Alaska or Hawaii.
